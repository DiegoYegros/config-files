look, if you're not doing a script for this, just take into consideration the following:
1. Install scrot. you need this to take screenshots.
2. Install psutil. You need this for the CPU module in bumblebee-status.
3. Install font-awesome. You need this for the icons.
4. Install pygit2. This is for git, ofc.

and thats it. Easy peasy.

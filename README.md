## Good to know
If you want to use the tmux theme and you're using WSL, you'll have to install a Nerd Font (JetBrainsMono Nerd Font, for instance) in your Windows Host and use it as the terminal font in order to get the glyphs working. Also remember to run the ./install-dependencies.sh and ./install-nerd-fonts.sh scripts.
